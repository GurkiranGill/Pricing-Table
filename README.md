##Pricing Table

https://gurkirangill.github.io/Pricing-Table/

I used this project to learn about the power of flex-box and media queries to make a responsive layout for a Pricing Table

The Web Page is responsive for a mobile and desktop display.

The Page has a breakpoint @ 900px:

- The flex-direction changes from column -> row.
- The Border scheme also changes.
- Some additional changes to padding and other properties are also made when increasing browser size after 900px.
